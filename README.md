## Dependency Installation

The respository is implemented with poetry for dependency management. To use please install poetry and then execute these commands in your terminal in the project. See the [official Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for more information.

```sh
$ poetry install # will install dependencies from the pyproject.toml file and add a poetry.lock file
$ poetry shell # will activate the virtual environment that has all dependencies installed
```
